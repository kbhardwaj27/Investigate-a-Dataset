# Investigate-a-Dataset
## Medical Appointments No-Show Analysis
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
  ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
  ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
  ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
  The encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

In this project, I went through the data analysis process and to see how everything fits together. 
I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

# After completing the project, I covered:

The steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
Got comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
How to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use.
Have experience communicating the results of the analysis.
Able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
Familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently.
How to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings.
