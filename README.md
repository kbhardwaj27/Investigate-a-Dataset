# Investigate-a-Dataset
## Medical Appointments No-Show Analysis
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
- ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
- ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
- The encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

In this project, I went through the data analysis process and to see how everything fits together. 
I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

# After completing the project, I covered:

- The steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Got comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- How to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use.
- Have experience communicating the results of the analysis.
- Able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
- Familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently.
- How to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings.
